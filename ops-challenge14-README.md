# What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
I learned how to write simple scripts. I got the opportunity to work through difficult code challenges and labs. I got to collaborate with classmates and come up with solutions to problems together. I also grew my network by reaching out to different IT professionals during our career assignments. 

# What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
My favorite Ops challenge would be Ops challenge three writing a string that prints the login history of the user. I liked this one because it was fairly easy and I did not have to use much resources to get the task completed. 

# How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
I don't know enough to determine that, but it allow some processes to run smoothly. For example, if we needed to pull the login data to see how many people swip there badge when they enter the workplace, that data would be easy to access. 

# What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
Honestly, all of them. I wish I had more time to go over them repeatly and grasp the concepts of all of them, but I had other assignments and had to push forward. The main one would be arrays though if I had to chose just one. 

# What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
All of them. I used resources and google to help me with all of my assignments and I want to get a better understanding on how each part of scripting works.
